This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon bug in COBOL's `PERFORM VARYING` statement that can lead to an infinite loop.  The issue arises from an improper placement of the counter increment. The original code increments the counter within the loop, causing it to never reach the termination condition. The solution provides a corrected version with the increment outside of the loop condition.
